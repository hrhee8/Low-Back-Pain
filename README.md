# Low-Back-Pain

The code includes two parts

1. Extracting the data
2. Modifying the data

The Initial Extraction process encountered problem where the extraction mechanism wasn't able to include the entire data set.
--> Extracting the RPDR file for every year needed to be done

Extracted data per year were then transformed into csv file where columns are separated based on specific patient demographics and diagnosis
- diagnosis codes were categorized by ICD9, ICD10, CPT Criteria

Exclusion models were applied to each dataset for further specification of a patient group.

Each group were then categorized as specific and nonspecific group based for further research purposes
